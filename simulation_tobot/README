So here comes Tobot the first ! =D
I'm pleased to announce his there.

--------------------------------------------------

Config => Yaml config of tobot
Launch => Launch file of the nodes for the simulation
rviz_files => sim.rviz the configuration file for rviz
URDF => URDF of Tobot

--------------------------------------------------

FIRST SIMPLE SIMULATION

Running in ROS using the arbotix simulator by Michael Ferguson and Rviz this code is a lot inspired by "ROS by examples" written by Patrick Goebel.

To launch the simulation, start a 

	roscore
	
in a terminal, 

Then use 

	launch simulation_tobot tobot.launch

This will start the necesseary nodes for the arbotix and rviz to calculate the frame. It use the tf package and the robot_state_publisher node to do the job of publishing the frame using the URDF of the robot. This is way the URDF is passed as a robot_description param in the launch file

The second command is :

	rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find simulation_tobot`/rviz/sim.rviz

This command launch rviz with some setup. I directly used the file provided in the ROS by examples. Thus I don't really know how it's working ^^...
It should launch the simulation properly and we just have to send a Twist to make the robot move.

I absoluetly don't understand the yaml file needed by Arbotix in the argument so I reused the one provided with the pi-robot. But I removed all the joints because it launch a controller node for each of the joint and I don't need that for now. I still got to read about the yaml page on the ROS website to fully understand what happen but for what I know it's seems to be a command file that launch nodes. I just checked what was happening using rostopic list.

If you have problem with the /map not existing, use /odom as a fixed frame, it should help ;).

Have fun playing with that minimalistic robot =D

----------------------------------------------------

SECOND SIMULATION USE OF MOVE_BASE

Use the exact same step as for the first simulation.

Then use this command : 

	roslaunch simulation_tobot fake_move_base_blank_map.launch
	
Don't forget that here the fixed frame have to /map for the simulation to work. Then use fixe 2D goal on Rviz to make the robot move. You could as well just send a Goal message to the move_base node.

How does this work : 
First we load the map to the server.
Second we launch move_base and it's configuration files. It use the yaml file sin the config/nav folder to load the parameters for move_base to work. If you want to tweak it, then, those yaml are a good place to start.
Second the launch fil create a tranform from /map to /odom that basically state that they don't move on compare to the other. It's just needed to do the odometry. Same for the transform from /base_link to /base_footprint used in the first launch file of the other example in case we use a base_footprint base as in the turtlebot.

To see the comportment with obstacles, just load fake_move_base_obstacles.launch instead ;).

Have fun :D


--------------------------------------------------

SPEECH RECOGNITION

Speech recognition use the pocket_sphix package.

For now I'm using the vocabulary made in Ros By Example. To launch the speech recognition launch a 

	roscore
	
And fire rviz and tobot launcher.

Then juste use those two commands : 

	roslaunch simulation_tobot voice_nav_commands.launch
	
Which launch the pocket_sphinx node that is going to listen to yor voice, followed by

	roslaunch simulation_tobot tobot_voice_nav.launch
	
Which launch a python script that take the recognized words of the topic created by the pocket_sphinx recognizer (which is /recognizer/output) and depend on which command it receive is going to move tobot accordingly.

Have fun ;).
